MineCraft Structure Definition Format (rev 1).

Status: Pre-alpha

# Overview #

Right now most people share their MineCraft creations by zipping up their world file and making it available somewhere. These files are many megabytes in size, containing much more information than the specific structure the author wanted to share.

2. examples - demonstrations of the file format using real samples
3. spec - the specification itself:w
